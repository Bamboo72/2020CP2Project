# 2020CP2Project: Maze Game
This project is a maze solving game. The player chooses between the sizes small, medium, large, and max and then navigates through the maze using either mouse or arrow controlls.

Here's the class diagram for my project: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1EtIvwePseLr5X5XyhewRGlthrah-qXjG/view?usp=sharing

My project evolved quite a bit, as you can by how different the original class diagram was:

### Ideas for Future Updates:
- My original plan was to incorporate story or semi-dating sim elements to the game, and I'd like to try adding that someday.
- I also wanted to include variations to the maze such as fetch quests, limited vision, or time trials.
- A save and load feature was planned, but cut because I needed more time to think it through.
