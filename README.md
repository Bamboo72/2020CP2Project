# 2020CP2Project: Maze Game
For my 2020-2021 Computer Programming 2 Project I made a maze solving game. The player chooses between the sizes small, medium, large, and max and then navigates through the maze using either mouse or arrow controlls.

## Year 2 Concepts
The Year 2 Concepts I focused on were:
- GUI controls
- Enhanced for loops
- Multidimensional arrays
- Collections
- I also used 1 ternary statement, inheritance with JFrame, and implementation of Key and Mouse Listeners

### Here's the class diagram for my project:

### My project evolved quite a bit, as you can by how different the original class diagram was:

### Ideas for Future Updates
- My original plan was to incorporate story or semi-dating sim elements to the game, and I'd like to try adding that someday.
- I also wanted to include variations to the maze such as fetch quests, limited vision, or time trials.
- A save and load feature was planned, but cut because I needed more time to think it through.
